# SI-RF-Structure

The article's [1] source code can be found in this repository. 

The repository is organized as:
  - **SOMLearning** This directory contains four scripts for learning the
  representations of a skin patch using a neural field self-organizing map.
  - **Responses** Containts all the necessary scripts for computing the receptive
  fields and their corresponding responses for each learning model.
  - **DiCarloProtocol** In this directory there are all the scripts for reproducing
  the experimental protocol introduced in [2]. The reproduction in here is purely
  numerical (*in silico*).
  - **Statistics** Here one can find all the scripts for running the statistical
  analysis presented in [1] (and originally in [2]).


### Caveat
> Before one starts using the code should first create the necessary directories
and modify the scripts accordingly.
